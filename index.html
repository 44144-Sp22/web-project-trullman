        <p>The Dungeon Master, also known as the DM, is the storyteller and referree.
        <p>Every DM is different. However, they all use the <a href="https://orkerhulen.dk/onewebmedia/DnD%205e%20Players%20Handbook%20%28BnW%20OCR%29.pdf" class="external-link">standard players handbook</a> as a reference for their requirments.</p>

        <p>The Dungeon Master, also known as the DM, is the referee and storyteller. Any Non-Player Character, NPCs, the DM will voice and tell you how they act. The DM will also determine whether you and your party, those you play with, encounter any enemies. While the players don't have knowledge on the enemies at first, the DM does and will move and roll for the enemies.</p>

        <p>Every DM is different and has different requirements, although they all base their requirements off of the standard players handbook.</p>
